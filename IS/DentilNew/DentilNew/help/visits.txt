In the "Visits" tab, a list of results of the patient's visit to a dentist will be displayed. You can search for traffic as you do on the "Patients" tab using the textbox next to the "Search" button.

Other options offered to you for a quick traffic search are the "Previous" and "Today" buttons. "Today" is intended to show you only the results of examinations that took place on the current day, while "Previous" is intended to show you the results of examinations of previous days.

If there are many search results, you can use pagination (if the button for switching the page is shaded, it means that it is not possible to scroll through the content on that page).

You can delete the content by first selecting the examination and then pressing the "Delete" button. The system will ask you to confirm that operation, and if you selected the "Yes" option, the system deletes that element.
