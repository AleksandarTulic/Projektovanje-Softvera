Within the "Add Visit" tab, the option to add a new examination result. 

All that is required is to select the patient from the combobox, and then from the right side in the window Problems and Services(treatments) add the problems in question and the methods of treatment(or services used). 

It is important to note that the only thing required to add an examination result is actually just selecting a user, everything else is optional.

There is a possibility that the patient you want to select is not offered in the combobox, in that case you can use the button "ADD PATIENT".

After all that, you need to click on the "ADD VISIT" button.
